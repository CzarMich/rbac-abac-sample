# Overview of the rbac-abac-sample README

 * This document demonstrates how to build and deploy the fortress rbac with abac sample.
 * The intent is to demonstrate using attributes to control role activation.
 * For more info about the idea: [Towards an Attribute-Based Role-Based Access Control System](https://iamfortress.net/2018/07/07/towards-an-attribute-based-role-based-access-control-system/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Prerequisites
1. Java 8
2. Apache Maven 3++
3. Apache Tomcat 7++
4. Basic LDAP server setup by completing either Quickstart
    * [OpenLDAP & Fortress QUICKSTART on DOCKER](https://github.com/apache/directory-fortress-core/blob/master/README-QUICKSTART-DOCKER-SLAPD.md)
    * [APACHEDS & Fortress QUICKSTART on DOCKER](https://github.com/apache/directory-fortress-core/blob/master/README-QUICKSTART-DOCKER-APACHEDS.md)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Prepare rbac-abac-sample package

1. Stage the project.

 a. Download and extract from Github:

 [Download ZIP](https://github.com/shawnmckinney/rbac-abac-sample/archive/master.zip)

 Or

 b. Or clone locally:

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/shawnmckinney/rbac-abac-sample.git
 ```

3. Change directory into it:

 ```
 cd rbac-abac-sample
 ```

4. Enable an LDAP server:

 ```
 cp src/main/resources/fortress.properties.example to fortress.properties
 ```

 Pick either Apache Directory or OpenLDAP server:

 a. Prepare fortress for apacheds usage:

 ```properties
 # This param tells fortress what type of ldap server in use:
 ldap.server.type=apacheds

 # Use value from [Set Hostname Entry]:
 host=localhost

 # ApacheDS defaults to this:
 port=10389

 # These credentials are used for read/write access to all nodes under suffix:
 admin.user=uid=admin,ou=system
 admin.pw=secret

 # This is min/max settings for LDAP administrator pool connections that have read/write access to all nodes under suffix:
 min.admin.conn=1
 max.admin.conn=10

 # This node contains fortress properties stored on behalf of connecting LDAP clients:
 config.realm=DEFAULT
 config.root=ou=Config,dc=example,dc=com

 # Used by application security components:
 perms.cached=true

 # Fortress uses a cache:
 ehcache.config.file=ehcache.xml
 ```

 b. Prepare fortress for openldap usage:

 ```properties
 # This param tells fortress what type of ldap server in use:
 ldap.server.type=openldap

 # Use value from [Set Hostname Entry]:
 host=localhost

 # OpenLDAP defaults to this:
 port=389

 # These credentials are used for read/write access to all nodes under suffix:
 admin.user=cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
 admin.pw=secret

 # This is min/max settings for LDAP administrator pool connections that have read/write access to all nodes under suffix:
 min.admin.conn=1
 max.admin.conn=10

 # This node contains fortress properties stored on behalf of connecting LDAP clients:
 config.realm=DEFAULT
 config.root=ou=Config,dc=example,dc=com

 # Used by application security components:
 perms.cached=true

 # Fortress uses a cache:
 ehcache.config.file=ehcache.xml
 ```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Prepare Tomcat for Java EE Security

This sample web app uses Java EE security.

1. Download the fortress realm proxy jar into tomcat/lib folder:

  ```
  wget http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/directory/fortress/fortress-realm-proxy/2.0.1/fortress-realm-proxy-2.0.1.jar -P $TOMCAT_HOME/lib
  ```

  where *TOMCAT_HOME* matches your target env.

2. Prepare tomcat to allow autodeploy of rbac-abac-sample web app:

 ```
 sudo vi /usr/local/tomcat8/conf/tomcat-users.xml
 ```

3. Add tomcat user to deploy rbac-abac-sample:

 ```
 <role rolename="manager-script"/>
 <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
 <user username="tcmanager" password="m@nager123" roles="manager-script"/>
 ```

4. Restart tomcat for new settings to take effect.

 Note: The proxy is a shim that uses a [URLClassLoader](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URLClassLoader.html) to reach its implementation libs.  It prevents
 the realm impl libs, pulled in as dependency to web app, from interfering with the containerâ€™s system classpath thus providing an error free deployment process free from
 classloader issues.  The proxy offers the flexibility for each web app to determine its own version/type of security realm to use, satisfying a variety of requirements
 related to web hosting and multitenancy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Build and deploy rbac-abac-sample

1. Set java and maven home env variables.

2. Run this command from the root package:

  Deploy to tomcat server:

  ```maven
 mvn clean tomcat:deploy -Dload.file
  ```

  Or if already deployed:

  ```maven
 mvn clean tomcat:redeploy -Dload.file
  ```

   -Dload.file tells maven to automatically load the rbac-abac-sample security policy into ldap.  Since the load needs to happen just once, you may drop the arg from future ops:
  ```maven
 mvn tomcat:redeploy
  ```
 **Note**: if problem  with tomcat auto-deploy, manually deploy rbac-abac-sample.war to webapps or change connection info used during tomcat:deploy in [pom.xml](pom.xml).
 ```
 <plugin>
     <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
     <artifactId>tomcat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     <version>1.0-beta-1</version>
     <configuration>
     ...
         <url>http://localhost:8080/manager/text</url>
         <path>/${project.artifactId}</path>
         <!-- Warning the tomcat manager creds here are for deploying into a demo environment only. -->
         <username>tcmanager</username>
         <password>m@nager123</password>
     </configuration>
 </plugin>
 ```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Understand the security policy

To gain full understanding, check out the file used to load it into the LDAP directory: ![rbac-abac-sample security policy](src/main/resources/rbac-abac-sample-security-policy.xml).

App comprised of three pages, each has buttons and links that are guarded by permissions.  The permissions are granted to a particular user via their role activations.

For this app, user-to-role assignments are:
### User-to-Role Assignment Table

| user       | Role_Tellers   | Role_Washers  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| curly      | true           | true          |
| moe        | true           | true          |
| larry      | true           | true          |

But we want to control role activation using attributes based on Branch location:

### User-to-Role Activation Table by Branch

| user       | Role_Tellers   | Role_Washers  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| curly      | East           | North, South  |
| moe        | North          | East, South   |
| larry      | South          | North, East   |

Even though the test users are assigned both roles, they are limited
which can be activated by branch.

Furthermore, we must never let the users be able to activate both roles simultaneously regardless of location.
For that, we'll use a dynamic separation of duty policy.

### Role-to-Role Dynamic Separation of Duty Constraint Table

| set name      | Set Members   | Cardinality   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bank Safe     | Role_Washers  | 2             |
|               | Role_Tellers  |               |
|               |               |               |

The buttons on the pages are guarded by rbac permission checks.  The permissions are dependent on which roles are active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Manually Test the rbac with abac sample

 1. Open link to [http://localhost:8080/rbac-abac-sample](http://localhost:8080/rbac-abac-sample)

 2. Login with Java EE authentication form:

 3. User-Password Table

 | userId        | Password      |
 | ------------- | ------------- |
 | curly         | password      |
 | moe           | password      |
 | larry         | password      |

 4. Enter a location for user and click on the button.

 5. Once the location is set, a link will appear corresponding with the user's allowed role for that location.
 Click on the link, and then buttons appear simulating user access for that particular location.

 6. Change locations, and a different link appears, with different operations.  This is RBAC with ABAC in
 action, limiting which role may be activated in the session by location.

 5. Try a different user.
  * Each has different access rights to application.

## Automatically Test the rbac with abac sample

Run the selenium automated test:

 ```
 mvn test -Dtest=RbacAbacSampleSeleniumITCase
 ```

 Selenium Test Notes:
 * *This test will log in as each user, perform positive and negative test cases.*
 * *Requires Firefox on target machine.*
